### Bad Code

* __Wading:__
  * Have you ever been significantly impeded by bad code? If you are a programmer of any experience then you've felt this impediment many times. Indeed, we havea  name for it. We call it wading.

  * Of course you have been impeded by bad code. So then-why did you write it?

  * Perhaps you felt that you didn't have time to do a good job.

  * That your boss would be angry with you if you took the time to clean up your code.

  * Perheps You were just tired of working on this program and wanted it to be over.

  * Or maybe you looked at the backlog of other stuff that had promised to get done and realized that you needed to slam this module together so you could move on to the next. We've all done it.
  
  * We've all said we'd go back and clean it up later. Of course, in those days we didn't know LeBlanc's law: _Later equals never_.
