# Chapter 1

## What is Design and Architecture?
- **Architecture**: Used in the context of something at a high level that is divorced from the lower-level details.
- **Design**: Implies structures and decisions at a lower level.
- The low-level details and the high-level structure are all part of the same whole. They form a continuous fabric that defines the shape of the system.

## Goal of a software architecture
- The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.
- If that effort is low, and stays low throughout the lifetime of the system. the design is good.
- If the effort grows with each new release, the design is bad.

## What Went Wrong?
- **Morals from Aesop**:
  - Slow and steady wins the race.
  - The race is not to the swift, nor the battle of the strong.
  - The more haste, the less speed.
- The developers buy into a familiar lie: **We can clean it up later. We just have to get to market first!**
- But the developers can not go back and clean things up because they've got to get the next feature done, an the next and the next and the next.
- The bigger lie that developers buy into is the notion that writing messy code makes them go fast in the short term, and just slows them down in the long term.
- **The only way to go fast, in to go well**.
- **Their overconfidence will drive the redesign into the same mess as the original project.**
